# BLEwithXenonAndChrome

Turns out Google Chrome can connect to other local devices through Bluetooth LE!
<br>
This Project was primarily just used to figure out how to connect Google Chrome to a Particle Xenon Microcontroller (no wifi, but with BLE functionality) and have the browser be able to remotely turn on and off a light controlled by the particle through BLE.
